Biomedical Entity Linking with Transformers

Much of the structure of this project is based on the pytorch tutorial ["Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling with nn.Transformer and TorchText"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transformer_tutorial.html).

The idea is to use a basic Transformer for Entity Linking in the UMLS biomedical knowledgebase. For this, we use the MedMentions corpus.
